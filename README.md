# pokemonAPI
mewtwo, flareon, rapidash
This surrogate API serves to provide JSON information for API calls for the Personal Pokedex (and group Pokemon Gym) projects to cut down on latency due to heavy load on the actual public Pokemon API (which in the best case scenarios was leading to huge delays in the development cycle, in the worst cases was leading to things like race conditions.)
